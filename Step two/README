Scaffold the corrected contigs using publically avaiable genomes for Aquilegia and the software RagTag

https://github.com/malonge/RagTag

2 aquilegia genomes are currently publically available
Aq coerulea ‘Goldsmith’ https://elifesciences.org/articles/36426
Aq oxysepala var. kansuensis https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-020-0328-y

Aim would be to try both and check consistency in scaffolding as a transposition exists in Aq oxysepala compared to Aq coerulea involving Chr4
